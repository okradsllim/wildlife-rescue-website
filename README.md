# wildlife-rescue-website

This project was created as part of a college web design class and demonstrates skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website is designed to educate users about a fictional wildlife rescue organization, with pages that include information about the organization, partnership opportunities, a gallery of rescued animals, and contact details.
